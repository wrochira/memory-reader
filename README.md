# Memory-Reader
A Python package for reading process memory in Windows or Linux.

This library is very basic. I wrote it so that I could prototype various bots in Python rather than having to do everything in C++.

Since I first wrote this, a library called mem_edit came about, which is much better: https://mpxd.net/code/jan/mem_edit
